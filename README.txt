We have implemented this application as CLI application. The Java code only controls the flow of the application and makes necessary procedure calls to the Database. All the logic related to the application is written and stored in Database. The file 'DDL.sql' will contain the Schema, Constraints, Procedures, Triggers and Functions that are implemented for this application.
